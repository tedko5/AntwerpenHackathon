# Antwerp@Night: Smarter, Safer Navigation After Dark
Antwerp@Night is a web-based navigation prototype designed to help users navigate Antwerp more safely at night. Built with Flask, OpenAI’s API, and OpenStreetMap, it combines natural language processing with lighting-dependent routing.
Unlike traditional mapping apps, which prioritize speed or distance, Antwerp@Night optimizes routes based on nighttime confidence, favoring well-lit, safer streets. The tool uses OSM tags and a touch of AI to generate safer walking routes for anyone.
## Key Features:
Natural Language Search: Users can enter queries like “Take me to the Groeplaats.” The AI takes the request, converts it into geographic coordinates, and generates a route.


- Lighting-Aware Routing: Using OSM data, the system prioritizes well-lit streets and avoids poorly lit areas, making routes more comfortable after dark.


- Dual Input Modes: Choose between “Smart Search” (natural language) and “Classic Navigation” (manual start/end).


- Turn-by-Turn Directions: Step-by-step instructions with street names, displayed alongside the interactive map.
## Why It Matters
Antwerp@Night offers more than just a route—it’s a tool for empowering users to make informed, confident decisions in low-visibility environments. Built with Flask, Leaflet, OpenAI, and OpenStreetMap, it’s a practical, AI-powered solution for safer urban navigation at night.
In under 24 hours, Vivian and Teodor built this prototype. We envision extending it with:
- Real-time safety or lighting updates
- Community-sourced feedback
## A Shift in Urban Mobility
In an AI-driven world, Antwerp@Night is a step toward AI that understands human context and doesn’t just optimize for efficiency.
